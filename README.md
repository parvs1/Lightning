# Lightning
Lightning is a path/motion planning, generation, and follower library for any type of robot - wheeled, flying, or even walking! The motion of any moving robot like the small autonomous vacuum cleaner in your house all the way up to a self-driving car can be profiled so that it moves more accurately, with more precision, and most importantly, faster! Like a lightning bolt!

The main approaches for motion profiling currently revolve around trapezoidal and s-curve motion profiles. The former is simpler and revolves around keeping robot acceleration constant during periods of time, while the latter is more complex and limits the jerk, leading to more reliability in the robot's performance in navigating. For path generation, there is a similar simpler and more complex strategy. The easier way is to take a set of robot's waypoints and connect them by lines. The more complex way is to take the waypoints and to generate cubic splines, leading to smooth paths that a robot should be able to traverse more efficiently. For the follower, the library has a two options: a pure pursuit algorithm/controller and a PID controller with a feedforward component. All of the methods for planning, generating, and following have upsides and downsides, so it is best to choose the most optimal ones based on the project's parameters and specifications.

This project is currently in development in both C++ (LightningC) and Python (PyLightning).
